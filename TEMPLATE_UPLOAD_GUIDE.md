# How to Update Your Website with a Zip Template

## Understanding the Limitation

Unfortunately, I cannot directly receive file uploads (like zip files) in this automated environment. However, I can help you update your website in several ways!

## Option 1: Manual Upload (Recommended)

You can manually upload your template files to the repository:

1. **Extract your zip file** on your local computer
2. **Clone this repository** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd qualion-site
   ```
   (You can find your repository URL on GitHub by clicking the green "Code" button)
3. **Replace or add files** from your template:
   - Copy the files from your extracted template into the repository
   - Keep or replace `index.html` as needed
   - Add any CSS, JavaScript, or image files
4. **Commit and push** your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update website with new template"
   git push
   ```

## Option 2: Share Template Details

If you can share details about your template, I can help in other ways:

1. **Provide a link** to the template (if it's publicly available)
2. **Describe the template** features you want to implement
3. **Copy and paste** key HTML/CSS code snippets you want to use
4. **Share the template name** if it's from a popular source (Bootstrap, HTML5 UP, etc.)

## Option 3: Describe Your Vision

Tell me what you'd like to change or improve:

- What features does the template have that you want?
- What sections do you need (About, Services, Portfolio, Contact, etc.)?
- Do you need specific functionality (forms, galleries, animations)?
- What's the overall design style you're aiming for?

## Current Website Structure

Your website currently has:
- Single HTML file (`index.html`) with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- Simple, professional design with purple gradient
- Language toggle (English/Swedish)
- Contact section with email

## Next Steps

Please choose one of the options above and let me know how you'd like to proceed. I'm here to help make your website better!
